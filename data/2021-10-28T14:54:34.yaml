- "Apple CEO  Tim Cook   was today asked  about some of the regulatory issues that\
  \ Apple is facing with the  App Store , and he said that Apple is keeping its focus\
  \ on privacy and security. Apple is facing potential regulatory changes that would\
  \ force it to open up the  iPhone  to other app stores or alternate ways of loading\
  \ apps on the \u200CiPhone\u200C. \n Cook went on to say that Apple is \"very focused\
  \ in discussing privacy and security of the \u200CApp Store\u200C with regulators\
  \ and legislators.\" Apple recently  came out largely victorious  in its antitrust\
  \ lawsuit with  Epic Games , with the judge in that case ruling that Apple does\
  \ not have a monopoly. Apple was, however, told to allow developers to put links\
  \ to outside websites and alternate payment options in their apps. Apple was given\
  \ a deadline in December to make this change, but Apple has appealed for more time\
  \ and has asked to  avoid making changes  until the entire case has come to a conclusion.\
  \ Back in June, U.S. lawmakers introduced antitrust legislation that would require\
  \ Apple to make  sweeping changes to the App Store , which Apple will undoubtedly\
  \ fight against."
