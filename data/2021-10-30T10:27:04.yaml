- "Apple has quietly discontinued the Intel-based 21.5-inch  iMac , which had remained\
  \ available as a low-end configuration suitable for educational institutions. This\
  \ leaves customers with the 24-inch and 27-inch \u200CiMac\u200C models to choose\
  \ from.  A single 21.5-inch \u200CiMac\u200C configuration  remained part of the\
  \ iMac lineup  following Apple's \"Unleashed\" event last week, but Apple has confirmed\
  \ it is being discontinued and will no longer be sold through its online store or\
  \ in Apple retail stores. The 21.5-inch model will remain available through third-party\
  \ providers while supplies last. The discontinued 21.5-inch \u200CiMac\u200C configuration\
  \ included a 2.3GHz dual-core 7th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM,\
  \ a 256GB SSD, and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 for $1,099. The \u200CiMac\u200C\
  \ lineup now starts with the new 24-inch model released in April of this year, with\
  \ key features including Apple's  M1  chip and an updated design available in several\
  \ colors. The 24-inch \u200CiMac\u200C starts at $1,299. For customers wanting an\
  \ even larger \u200CiMac\u200C, the 27-inch \u200CiMac\u200C remains in the lineup.\
  \  Apple stopped selling several higher-end 21.5-inch \u200CiMac\u200C configurations\
  \ after the 24-inch model launched and now the 21.5-inch model has been discontinued\
  \ entirely. Apple continues to sell some  refurbished 21.5-inch iMac models  through\
  \ its online store. (Thanks, Mark!)"
