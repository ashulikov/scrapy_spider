- Meta, the  company formerly known as Facebook , has been working on a smart watch
  designed to compete with the Apple Watch  since early this year , and now  Bloomberg  has
  obtained pictures of the device. The smart watch has a design that's not too far
  off from the Apple Watch, but it is wider and rounder with more curved edges. There
  is a camera at the bottom of the display, along with a control button on the right
  side. According to  Bloomberg , the watch features a detachable wrist strap and
  a button at the top of the case.  Prior rumors  have suggested the watch will have
  a detachable display with two built-in cameras for taking pictures and videos to
  share to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. A camera on the front of the display
  will be used for video calls, while a secondary camera on the back can be used for
  capturing photos when the body is detached from the stainless steel watch frame.
  The device will offer a cellular connection that does not require a smartphone,
  and wearers will be able to send messages with services like Messenger and WhatsApp.
  It is also expected to have built-in health tracking features like a heart rate
  monitor. Meta, which operates social networking site Facebook, already sells Oculus
  virtual reality headsets and the Facebook Portal video calling devices, but the
  smart watch will be its first wearable. Meta is planning to launch the watch as
  early as 2022, but there is no solidified timeline for release as of yet and plans
  could still change. If the device does debut in 2022, it will compete with the upcoming  Apple
  Watch Series 8 .
